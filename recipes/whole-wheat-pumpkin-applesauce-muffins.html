    <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan or line with paper liners. </li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, applesauce, pumpkin, eggs, white sugar, buttermilk, and oil in a large bowl; mix until well blended. Stir in flour mixture until combined. Fold in raisins and pecans. Divide batter evenly into the prepared muffin pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before removing muffins to a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
