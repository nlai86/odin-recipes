    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pumpkin-applesauce muffins are perfect for those times when you have half a can of pumpkin left over. The muffins taste great right from the oven but are even better the next day — if they last that long! Kids love them, and it's a good way to sneak fruits, veggies, and fiber into their diets.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>⅔ cup brown sugar, firmly packed</li>
        <li>½ cup applesauce</li>
        <li>½ cup canned pumpkin</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, slightly beaten</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup golden raisins (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped pecans (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan or line with paper liners. </li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, applesauce, pumpkin, eggs, white sugar, buttermilk, and oil in a large bowl; mix until well blended. Stir in flour mixture until combined. Fold in raisins and pecans. Divide batter evenly into the prepared muffin pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before removing muffins to a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
